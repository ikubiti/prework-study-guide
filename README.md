# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a prospective web developer, I seek ways to improve my ability to keep the valuable insights I discover on my journey. I also hope such an application should help anyone needing to make incisive notes on any activity of their interest. I built this application as a means to have a central resource to store and access valuable lessons learned in my software development career. The application is a convenient solution for anyone who needs to make notes about their activities for easy recall. During its development, I learned to use HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript for the first time.
